# MD-pipline-package
This library supports multiple stages of MD simulations, from system creation to analysis of GROMACS and LAMMPS trajectories. It offers extensive analysis tools, particularly for polymers in confined systems, tools for functionalizing silica substrates, and functions for merging systems and adding small molecules to bulk liquids.
